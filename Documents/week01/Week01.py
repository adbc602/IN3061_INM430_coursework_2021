#Variables in Python:

#Variables store values, they can be looked at or changed within the code. 

   
#total = 0
#for i in range(1,10):
    #total = total + i
    #print(total)
#print ("Final Total: ", total)

#Functions in Python:

#Functions are needed to encapsulate functionalities and make them resusable.
#def say_hello_to(name):
   # print("Hello " + name)

#say_hello_to("Cagatay")
#say_hello_to("Fred")

#Conditionals in Python:

#Conditions are also central to programming to model the logical flow of the code. Change the value variable to see how the if-conditions behave:

#value = 5
#if value > 0:
   # print("This is positive!")
#elif value < 0:
    #print("This is negative!")
#else:
   # 
    
 #Comments in Python:

#Any line that starts with a # is ignored.

#Please ignore me.   

#Data types in Python:
#Basic types:

#x = 3          # numbers  
#a = "gorillas" # strings  
#t = True       # booleans

#Lists:

#What if you have several of the same sort of things? You can use lists to store collections of things. An empty list is declared as []. And we can add elements with append.

#myFavouriteParks = []
#myFavouriteParks.append("Victoria")
#myFavouriteParks.append("Hampstead Heath")
#myFavouriteParks.append("Richmond")
#print (myFavouriteParks)
#print ("-----------------------------------")
#print ("Now the same with a for-loop:")
#for value in myFavouriteParks:
#    print (value)

#Dictionaries

#The other main data type is the dictionary. The dictionary allows you to associate one piece of data (a "key") with another (a "value"). The analogy comes from real-life dictionaries, where we associate a word (the "key") with its meaning. Declare an empty dictionary with {}

#foods = {}
#foods["banana"] = "Yellow"
#foods["avocado"] = "green"
#foods
#foods["banana"]
#print ("now trying with a non-existent key:")


#Loading packages in Python: As we will be making use of several packages and libraries in Python. We need to load them before we use them. This is where import comes into play.
#print ("We need to load the package first:")
